    <h6>Coming Soon: Your Personalized Nutrition Blueprint</h6>
    <p>
        We’re working on a brand-new feature that will tailor food recommendations just for you—taking
        into account your age, activity level, dietary preferences, and health goals (whether you want
        to lose weight, build muscle, or simply feel your best). In a future update you’ll be able to
        answer a few quick questions and instantly get a customized meal plan, snack ideas, and portion
        guides that adapt as your goals evolve. Stay tuned!
