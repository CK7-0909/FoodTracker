    <h1>About FoodTracker</h1>
    <p>
        FoodTracker makes it easy to look up nutrition facts, log what you eat, and
        track your macros over time. Search thousands of foods, save your entries to
        custom meal logs, and visualize your intake trends on interactive charts.

            <strong>Coming Soon: Your Personalized Nutrition Blueprint</strong><br/>
            We’re working on a brand-new feature that will tailor food recommendations just
            for you—taking into account your age, activity level, dietary preferences, and
            health goals (whether you want to lose weight, build muscle, or simply feel your
            best). In a future update you’ll be able to answer a few quick questions and
            instantly get a customized meal plan, snack ideas, and portion guides that adapt
            as your goals evolve. Stay tuned!
